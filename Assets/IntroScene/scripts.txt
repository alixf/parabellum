Human kind learnt to master light as their primary energy source.
They built powerful devices and named this technology "LightTech".

However, other races grew jealous of their power and tried to destroy their civilization.
Caught by surprise, the few survivors had to flee beneath the surface of the earth.

Deprived of light and therefore, of their technology, they survived there for many years.
But one day, they found one ancient device, an almost-functionning warship, The A.V.G Parabellum.

They named you as the pilot of this wonderful vehicle and it's now your mission to save the earth.
